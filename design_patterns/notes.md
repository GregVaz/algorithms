# Design patterns

Design patterns provide typical soluctions to commonly recurring problems ins software design.

> Rather than providing specific pieces of software, design patterns are merely concepts that can be used to handle recurring themes in an optimized way.

- Singleton Pattern
  - Classes which can be instantiated once, and can be accessed globally.
- Proxy Pattern
  - We get more control over the interactions with certain objects. A proxy object can determine the behavior whenever we're interacting with the object.
