1. How many steps would it take to perform a linear search for the number 8 in the ordered array, [2,4,6,8,10,12,13]?

2. How many steps would binary search take for the previous example?

3. What is the maximum number of steps it would take to perform a binary searcg on an array of size 100,000?

> 1.r = 4 steps

> 2.r = 1 steps

> 3.r = 17 steps = 2^17 ~ 130,000
