1. Draw what the following heap would look like after we insert the value 11 into it:

```
              10
            /    \
          /        \
        9           8
      /   \        /  \
    6      5     7    4
  /   \   /
 2     1  3
```

2. Draw what the previous heap would like after we delete the root node

3. Imagine you've build a brand-new heap by inserting the following numbers into the heap in this particular order: 55, 22, 34, 10, 2, 99, 68. If you then pop them from the heap one at a time and insert them numbers into a new array, in what order would the numbers now appear?
